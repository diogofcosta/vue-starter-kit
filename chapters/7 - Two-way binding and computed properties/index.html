	<h3>Chapter 7 - Two-way bindings and computed properties</h3>

	<!-- initially i want it to be set to my name variable's value... and be in sync with it, but if i change the input -->
	<!-- then i also want it to update my variable... so i want it binded two-ways -->
	<!-- we already know how to change a variable based on the input's value with event handling...
	now it's just a matter of also binding the value of the input... to state of our variable.. and we ALSO know how to do it
	even if we haven't done it before... we know how to bind an attribute to a certain piece of code... in this case to our name -->
	<input type="text" @input="updateName" />
	<input type="text" :value="name" />

	<!-- v-model directive does that for us out of the box which is pretty awesome!! -->
	<input type="text" v-model="name" />

	<p>{{ name }}</p>

	<hr />

	<!--
		imagine we want to keep track of a counter, but we also want to have another variable change state
		depending on the state of our counter... should be fairly easy to do yeah?
	-->
	<button @click="increaseCounter">Increase counter and update result</button>
	<button @click="decreaseCounter">Decrease counter and update result</button>
	<p>Counter: {{ counter }}</p>

	<!-- seems overly complicated to have all this code in the template.. and not very "flexible and re-usable"
	so how can we improve it? -->
	<p>Result: {{ counter > 5 ? 'Greater than 5' : 'Smaller than 5' }}</p>
  
	<!-- lets use a data property instead to keep track of it so we can reuse it! -->
	<p>Result: {{ result }}</p>

	<!-- however we now have a problem... everytime we call the increate/decreate methods.. we update the counter
	and we also have to update every variable that depends on counter... otherwise it won't reflect those changes-->

	<!-- computed properties behave just like data properties except vue keeps track of what they depend on...
	and updates their value whenever their dependencies are updated! -->
	<p>Result (computed style): {{ resultComputed }}</p>
	<!-- a good thing to note... is that now even if don't update the result variable... if we use the computed it will auto update it! 
	instead of calling the method to increase/decrease taht also updates the result variable.. lets just increment the counter and see that
  still works the computed property!-->
	<button @click="counter++">Increase counter</button>
	<button @click="counter--">Decrease counter</button>

	<!-- talk about watchers... anothre way to react to changes to a certain variable -->
	<p>Api call status: {{ apiData ? apiData : 'Still no api data :(' }}</p>
