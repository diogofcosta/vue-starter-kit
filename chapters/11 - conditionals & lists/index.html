  <!-- v-if removes the entire element from the DOM it doesn't simply hide it like v-show does
  check how in the DOM the element "disappears" rather than being hidden -->

  <!-- outputting lists... use v-for! will repeat the element (dom) for however many elements there are in the array! -->

  <!-- simple objects can be outputted directly! -->
  <ul>
    <li v-for="ingredient in ingredients">
      {{ ingredient }}
    </li>

  <hr/>

  <!-- complex objects can also be outputted! We can access the properties of the current object! -->
  <ul>
    <!-- also access the index if you need it! -->
    <li v-for="(person, index) in people">
      {{ index }} - {{ person.name }} (age is... {{ person.age }}) - Likes {{ person.team }}

  <!-- another syntax to iterate over numbers, albeit not very useful... it may have a use scenario sometimes -->
  <ul>
    <li v-for="n in 10">{{ n }}</li>
  </ul>

  <hr/>

  <!-- we can navigate or iterate through each property of an object with a nested for.. if you have
   weird niche use case scenario like that! :D be mindful that the order of the variables is important
  first one will ALWAYS be the value -->
  <!-- when possible try to pass a unique key (identifier as a param) when using the v-for
  to give Vue a HINT of how to track the object if it ever changes and being able to re-render in
  a faster way... by default it tracks it by index, and patches the element that's changing only
  it's a decent way but may have some caveats that may not work for your use case, so it is recommended
  whenever you can to use a unique identifier to help vue keep track of the item itself
