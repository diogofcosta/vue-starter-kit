	<h3>Chapter 5 - Events</h3>

	<!-- Let's dive deeper into events and how to handle them
	lets say i have a button here that once its clicked i want it to increment our counter
	so we need to defined a method to increment the counter (or use it directly here ofc) and
	also we need to defined the variable that will hold that counter! -->
	<button @click="incrementCounter">Click me</button>

	<!-- also for good measure we need to actually see our counter.. so let's output it here -->
	<p>Counter: {{ counter }}</p>

	<!-- so everytime we click that button.. the incrementCounter method is called and it will
	well... increment our counter which gets updated automatically on the view -->


	<!-- basically any native javascript event that exists.. we can bind to using this syntax
	let's say i want to check the coordinates of the mouse when hovering over this block,
	we need to create the method that updates its and the variables in the data object to hold the values -->

	<!-- and afterwards we want to actually see the coordinates being changed so let's output them here -->
	<p @mousemove="updateCoordinates">Mouse coordinates: ({{ xCoord }}, {{ yCoord }})</p>

	<!-- note that as i said before... if we dont pass any parameter to our method on an event listener
	then vue will automatically pass it the native JS event object... however if we do decide to pass
	a parameter we can still access the native event by using the $event reserved variable -->
	<button @click="incrementCounter(2)">Click me to increase by 2</button>

	<!-- could also do this... it works directly incrementing a button -->
	<button @click="counter++">Click me to increase counter</button>
	<p>Counter: {{ counter }}</p>

	<!-- any valid JS code can be used in between the curly braces -->
	<p>Counter: {{ counter * 2 }}</p>
	<p>Counter: {{ counter * 2 > 10 ? 'Greater than 10' : 'Smaller than 10' }}</p>

	<!-- what if... we want to override the event that's already being listened to? let's go back to the mouse move
	and coordinates example! in this case we want it to update when moving the mouse... except in a certain part
	of it! we can override the listener by binding to it and calling another method... on that method we use
	JS native event behavior to stop the propagation upwards (event bubbling) and therefore it will not update the coordinates -->
	<p @mousemove="updateCoordinates">
		<span>Mouse coordinates: ({{ xCoord }}, {{ yCoord }}) -</span>
		<span @mousemove="dummy">This area does not update the coordinates</span>
	</p>

	<!-- vue provides us with useful event modifiers so we don't have to do all those shenanigans to prevent event bubbling we
	can simply use the stop and prevent modifiers to achieve the same result! -->
	<p @mousemove="updateCoordinates">
		<span>Mouse coordinates: ({{ xCoord }}, {{ yCoord }}) -</span>
		<span @mousemove.stop>This area does not update the coordinates</span>
	</p>

	<!-- very spammy every key up will raise it... lets improve it with key modifiers -->
	<input type="text" @keyup="alertUser" />

	<!-- only trigger the method when the key released is the enter key! -->
	<!-- list of key modifiers - https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/events.html#Key-Modifiers
        They can be chained.... @event.enter.space.tab will work for any of those 3! -->
	<input type="text" @keyup.enter="alertUser" />
