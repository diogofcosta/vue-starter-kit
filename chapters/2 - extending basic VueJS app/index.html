    <!-- now let's extend our very simple app before diving deeper into other features, lets add an input -->
    <!-- what i want to do here is update our message based on the state of this input... -->
    <!-- i do so by using a special directive, a command that vuejs will recognize, that will tell ti listen to a certain even.. in this case the input event
    and react to it and do something in this case we'll call a certain method-->
    <!-- the method now must be created as it doesnt exist at first -->

        changeMessage: function(event) {

            // with this we can access the data that said event has

            // we dont use data.message as you'd expect.. instead we use this.. and this refering to data might seem odd
            // but under the hood vue works its magic and exposes the variables on the data property, and methods and other things we'll see
            // under the this keyword, in this case refering to the vue instance itself!

            // i know the event will have a target, which will be the input field.. and that input field has a value.. so lets use that to
            // change our message
            this.message = event.target.value
        },
        // this one returns a value which COULD be used in the template to set something like the message
