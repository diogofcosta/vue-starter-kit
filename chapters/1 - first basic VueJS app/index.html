<!-- not very interesting at all? just static content-->
<p>Static Hello world!</p>

<!-- lets enclose it with a div that we'll let vue know to take control of! -->
<!-- Now that we've imported VueJS we can start using it and all its features! -->
<div id="app">
    <!-- here we'll just print out a static hello world, which by itself isn't very interesting... -->
    <p>Static Hello world!</p>

    <!-- however we can now start making use of vue's features and making it more dynamic, let's say i want to output a message based on a certain variable -->
    <!-- now that vuejs knows to take control of this div, we can simply use this special syntax double {{}} to signal vue to look for the variable u put inside it
    in the data object of the vue instance! -->
    <p>
        {{ message }}
    </p>
</div>

<!-- for now we'll instantiate the vue instance on the same html file, later on we'll talk about using SFC's and how they're more organized to use -->

    // vue instances created like this are the core of each application, every piece of code that you want to use vue in
    // everything here is javascript and will allow us to make use of it to interact with the page (our HTML)

    // we have to tell vue in which element we want it to insert or plug itself into, we do this by using the el (short for element option)

        message: 'This is from the vue instance!'
